# admin-dashboard-ToP-
This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Admin-dashboard"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

As the name suggest the main goal is to create a Admin-dashboard. This way everything learned about grid and flex in practice.

Fist we created the different sections that the page will have. Is a good idea to created them in different div containers that way the manipulation of the elements will be easier. Impleting the Emmet shorcuts the HTML sections where easily created with the appropiated indentation. Note: all the content was created including the svg, forms, text and headers.

Ones the content it's created is time for the style. That's where we applied all the CSS of grid & flex to manipulated the layout the GUI look good.
